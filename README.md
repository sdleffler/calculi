# Lambda calculus playground

This is a small project intending for learning about/messing with variants of the [λ-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

Currently implemented:
- Untyped λ-calculus
- Simply typed λ-calculus (no `let` assignments)
- System F
- λω-calculus (the lower, far, left-hand corner of the [λ-cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube). Non-polymorphic lambda calculus with type operators.)

Coming soon:
- System Fω
- At least some flavor of dependently typed λ-calculus

This project is intended as a learning experience for myself, as well as a general test of how difficult a dependently typed system is to write - if it's easy enough, I'll eventually try to write my own dependently typed language!
